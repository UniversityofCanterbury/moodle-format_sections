## Sections Course Format

This is a Moodle course format based on the "Topics" format, but adding some extra features.

The Moodle 4.0 branch is a rewrite of the old code - based on the core Topics format but adding in the following features:
  * Hide section 0 when viewing another section
  * Add a news forum/social forum display under section 0 when viewing the course "home"
  * Allow the user to swap between showing one topic per page and all topics on the same page.
